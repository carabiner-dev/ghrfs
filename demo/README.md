# Demo Program

This directory contains a [simple program](main.go) that creates a filesystem 
out of a release[^1].

The demo program creates the filesystem, runs a Walk through it, opens a file,
prints its attributes and reads its contents.

[^1]: The test release is this project's [v0.0.0 release](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/ghrfs/releases/tag/v0.0.0) which is designed to run its tests.
